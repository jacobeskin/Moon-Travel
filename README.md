# Moon-Travel
Trip to the moon

"kuumatka_xv.py" is a simple script demonstrating how the position and velocity of a space ship change as a function of time when travelling by unpowered flight with initial velocity of 12012 m/s. 

The script "kuumatka.py" demonstrates how the choice of time step in the simple Euler method for approximating the derivatives affects the calculated travelling time.

"Aika.jpg" has the time step on x-axis and travel time on y-axis, and shows that the larger the time step the longer the calculted travel time.

"xv.jpg" has the travel time on x-axis and travel distance and velocity on the y-axis in the top and bottom graphs respectively.
